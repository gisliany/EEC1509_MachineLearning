        "**AirBnB** is a marketplace for short term rentals that allows you to list part or all of your living space for others to rent. You can rent everything from a room in an apartment to your entire house on AirBnB. Because most of the listings are on a short-term basis, AirBnB has grown to become a popular alternative to hotels. The company itself has grown from it's founding in 2008 to a 30 billion dollar [valuation in 2016](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-05/airbnb-files-to-raise-850-million-at-30-billion-valuation) and is currently worth more than any hotel chain in the world.\n",
        "\n",
        "One challenge that hosts looking to rent their living space face is determining the optimal nightly rent price. In many areas, renters are presented with a good selection of listings and can filter on criteria like price, number of bedrooms, room type and more. Since AirBnB is a marketplace, the amount a host can charge on a nightly basis is closely linked to the dynamics of the marketplace. Here's a screenshot of the search experience on AirBnB:\n",

        "\n",
        "As a host, if we try to charge above market price for a living space we'd like to rent, then renters will select more affordable alternatives which are similar to ours.. If we set our nightly rent price too low, we'll miss out on potential revenue.\n",
        "\n",
        "One strategy we could use is to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- find a few listings that are similar to ours,\n",
        "- average the listed price for the ones most similar to ours,\n",
        "- set our listing price to this calculated average price.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process of discovering patterns in existing data to make a prediction is called **machine learning**. In our case, we want to use data on local listings to predict the optimal price for us to set. In this lesson, we'll explore a specific machine learning technique called **k-nearest neighbors**, which mirrors the strategy we just described. Before we dive further into machine learning and k-nearest neighbors, let's get familiar with the dataset we'll be working with."

While this is helpful deliberate practice to understand how the mechanics work, you can be more productive and iterate quicker by using a library that handles most of the implementation. In this subsection, we'll learn about the [scikit-learn library](http://scikit-learn.org/), which is the most popular machine learning in Python. Scikit-learn contains functions for all of the major machine learning algorithms and a simple, unified workflow. Both of these properties allow data scientists to be incredibly productive when training and testing different models on a new dataset.\n",

In our case, we want to use the [KNeighborsRegressor class](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor.html#sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor).\n",
        "Any model that helps us predict numerical values, like listing price in our case, is known as a **regression** model. The other main class of machine learning models is called classification, where we're trying to predict a label from a fixed set of labels (e.g. blood type or gender).

        "**Bias** describes error that results in bad assumptions about the learning algorithm. For example, assuming that only one feature, like a car's weight, relates to a car's fuel efficiency will lead you to fit a simple, univariate regression model that will result in high bias. The error rate will be high since a car's fuel efficiency is affected by many other factors besides just its weight.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Variance** describes error that occurs because of the variability of a model's predicted values. If we were given a dataset with 1000 features on each car and used every single feature to train an incredibly complicated multivariate regression model, we will have low bias but high variance. In an ideal world, we want low bias and low variance but in reality, there's always a tradeoff.\n",

A mathematical model is usually an equation that can exist without the original data, which isn't true with k-nearest neighbors. In the next classes, we'll learn about a mathematical model called linear regression. We'll explore the bias-variance tradeoff in greater depth in these next 2 courses because of its importance when working with mathematical models in particular.\n"
