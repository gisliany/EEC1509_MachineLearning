The different measures we learned about have very similar names and it's easy to confuse them. Don't fret! The important takeaway is the ability to frame the question you want to answer and working backwards from that to formulate the correct calculation.\n","\n","If you want to know how well a binary classification model is at catching positive cases, you should have the intuition to divide the correctly predicted positive cases by all actually positive cases. There are 2 outcomes associated with an admitted student (positive case), a false negative and a true positive. Therefore, by dividing the number of true positives by the sum of false negatives and true positives, you'll have the proportion corresponding to the model's effectiveness of identifying positive cases.

When we have three or more categories, we call the problem a **multiclass classification problem**. There are a few different methods of doing multiclass classification and in this section, we'll focus on the **one-versus-all method**.\n","\n","The **one-versus-all** method is a technique where we choose a single category as the Positive case and group the rest of the categories as the False case. **We're essentially splitting the problem into multiple binary classification problems.** For each observation, the model will then output the probability of belonging to each category.\n","\n","To start let's split our data into a training and test set.
